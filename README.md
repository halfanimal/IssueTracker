# IssueTracker
To practice what you have learned in Web Technologien 3, you will do a project instead of a series of labs. You can do this exercise in a group. Please form groups of 2-3 students on your own. This project is weighed 20% for the Ô¨Ånal grade.


## The Goal
* Responsiveness in look and feel 
* Persistent Issues (localStorage)
* Load from and save to a server (REST)
* Back-end to faciliate the above (Optional)

## Milestones
These are the iterations in which you will create the Issue Tracker. They have been chosen to:
* Be aligned with the theory in the lectures
* Make the scope of the respective technologies explicit to facilitate a better understanding
* Represent a natural succession of steps for a project of this scope

The milestones will each be explained in more detail further down in this document. 
1. **HTML/CSS Prototype with Web Server** (due: Week 4)
2. **Logic, RiotJS, localStorage** (due: Week 9)
3. **RESTful API (due: Week 11) 3B Custom back end service (Optional)** (due: Week 14)
4. **Deployment** (due: Week 13)
